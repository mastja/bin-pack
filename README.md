# bin-pack

Bin Packing (BP) Problem in C++

Compiled with makefile

To build the program, type "make" or "make all".

Then, following the previous command, to run binPack program, type "binPack" Make sure you have a bin.txt file in your directory, this file provides input according to the prompt:

  The first line is the number of test cases, followed by the capacity of bins for that
  test case, the number of items and then the weight of each item. You can assume that the weight of
  an item does not exceed the capacity of a bin for that problem. 

When makeChange executable runs, output is written to the console.
